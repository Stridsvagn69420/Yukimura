# Security Policy
## Supported Versions
In general, only the latest version is supported for obvious reasons. This is rolling release. I use Arch, btw.  
Note that I also don't support nightly toolchains, so if you do encounter an error, check if it's still there on stable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
I **don't** expect any remote code execution vulnerabilities or any that can just steal your data.  
I **do** expect vulnerabilities for both the binary and library like crashing an application though some weird RAM-Bit-Memory-magic, although this is Rust and this *shouldn't* happen.

Anyway, if you do find a vulnerability, directly create an issue about it and I'll try to fix it. The issue can also be about the output being wrong.
